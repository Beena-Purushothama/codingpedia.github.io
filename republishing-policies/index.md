__Last update - October 2014__

Our content policies play an important role in maintaining a positive, and especially useful experience for our visitors. The Codingpedia editorial team does not republish articles arbitrarily. We follow a strict set of rules and guidelines. Every article republished on Codingpedia fulfills certain criteria: quality of content is important to us, and our job is to advocate for and protect the interests of our readers and the coding community. Every article is reviewed by at least a technical expert before it gets published on Codingpedia.
