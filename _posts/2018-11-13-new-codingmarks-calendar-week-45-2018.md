## api 

**[The Nuts and Bolts of API Security: Protecting Your Data at All Times - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj03NRM6SP8)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2015-05-20

**[API Keys ≠ Security: Why API Keys Are Not Enough](https://nordicapis.com/why-api-keys-are-not-enough/)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2018-02-02
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [rest](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[rest]), &nbsp; [api](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[api])

[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj03NRM6SP8)

API Keys are not security. By design they lack granular control, and there are many vulnerabilities at stake: applications that contain keys can be decompiled to extract keys, or deobfuscated from on-device storage, plaintext files can be stolen for unapproved use, and password managers are susceptible to security risks as with any application. In this piece we outline the disadvantages of solely relying on API keys to secure the proper access to your data.

## free-programming-books 

**[James Shore: Agile-Book](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [free-programming-books](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[free-programming-books]), &nbsp; [agile](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[agile])

## git 

**[linux - Git keeps asking me for my ssh key passphrase - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10032461/git-keeps-asking-me-for-my-ssh-key-passphrase)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [git](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[git]), &nbsp; [ssh](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[ssh])

Once you have started the SSH agent with:
```
$ eval $(ssh-agent)
```
You have to add your private key to it `$ ssh-add` - this will ask you your passphrase just once, and then you should be allowed to push, provided that you uploaded the public key to Github.

To save key permanently: `$ ssh-add -K`  - this will persist it after you close and re-open it by storing it in user's keychain.

## java 

**[Why getter and setter methods are evil](https://www.javaworld.com/article/2073723/core-java/why-getter-and-setter-methods-are-evil.html)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2003-09-05
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [java](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[java])

The getter/setter idiom is a commonplace feature in many Java programs. Most of these accessor methods, however, are unnecessary and can severely impact your systems' maintainability. Using accessors violates the basic object-oriented (OO) principle of encapsulation, so you should avoid them. This article discusses getter/setter cons and offers an alternative design methodology.
