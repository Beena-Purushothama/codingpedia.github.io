## async 

**[Parallel calls with async-await in javascript - I promise you all performance and simplicity](http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/parallel-calls-with-async-await-in-javascript-i-promise-you-all-performance-and-simplicity)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2017-11-13
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [nodejs](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[nodejs]), &nbsp; [async-await](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[async-await]), &nbsp; [async](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[async]), &nbsp; [javascript](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[javascript])

I was blown away about the simplicity and performance gain of making parallel calls with the new async-await feature in javascript. See the blog post to understand why.

## caching 

**[How to build and clear a reference data cache with singleton EJBs and MBeans](http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/how-to-build-and-clear-a-reference-data-cache-with-singleton-ejbs-and-mbeans/)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2014-09-19
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [caching](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[caching]), &nbsp; [ejb](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[ejb]), &nbsp; [javaee](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[javaee])

In one of my projects I had a requirement to load reference data from several sources in a Java EE 6 WebLogic environment, with EclipseLink as ORM framework. Since I couldn’t find an annotation in the Java EE world comparable to the sweet @Cacheable from Spring YET, I had to write my “own” caching solution. Although reference data barely changes over time, one extra requirement was to be able to clear the cache from exterior. So here it goes…
