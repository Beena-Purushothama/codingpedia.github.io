This whitepaper is intended for existing and potential customers who are
designing the security infrastructure and configuration for applications running
in Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides security best practices that will help
you define your Information Security Management System (ISMS) and build a set
of security policies and processes for your organization so you can protect your
data and assets in the AWS Cloud. The whitepaper also provides an overview of
different security topics such as identifying, categorizing and protecting your
assets on AWS, managing access to AWS resources using accounts, users and

## business-process 

**[Recovery point objective - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_point_objective)**

A **recovery point objective (RPO)** is defined by business continuity planning. It is the maximum targeted period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident. The RPO gives systems designers a limit to work to. For instance, if the RPO is set to four hours, then in practice, off-site mirrored backups must be continuously maintained – a daily off-site backup on tape will not suffice.
