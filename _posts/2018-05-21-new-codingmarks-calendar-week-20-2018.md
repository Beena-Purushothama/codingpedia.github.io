## glossary 

**[Request for Comments (RFC) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [glossary](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[glossary])

A Request for Comments (RFC), in the context of Internet technology, is a type of publication from the Internet technical community, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet. RFCs may also come from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or independent authors. The RFC system is supported by the Internet Society (ISOC).

An RFC is authored by engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet Standards. However, many RFCs are informational or experimental in nature and are not standards
