With more than 25 photos and 90 likes every second, we store a lot of data here at Instagram. To make sure all of our important data fits into memory and is available quickly for our users, we’ve begun to shard our data — in other words, place the data in many smaller buckets, each holding a part of the data.

## continuous-deployment 

**[GitHub - openshift/source-to-image: A tool for building/building artifacts from source and injecting into docker images](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [openshift](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[openshift]), &nbsp; [docker](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[docker]), &nbsp; [continuous-deployment](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[continuous-deployment])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible Docker images from source code. S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a Docker container and letting the container prepare that source code for execution. By creating self-assembling builder images, you can version and control your build environments exactly like you use Docker images to version your runtime environments.

**[What is digital signature? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmA2QWSLSPg&list=PLSNNzog5eydtwsdT__t5WtRgvpfMzpTc7)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [cryptography](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cryptography])

A digital signature is equivalent to a handwritten signature in paper, and a digital signature serves three basic purposes. Digital signature is commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions and other cases where it is important to detect forgery. Digital signatures are very popular with e-mail users. 

In this video, I will talk about the digital, uses, and the whole process of creating and sending digitally signed document over the Internet. 

Keep in mind, digital signature is not about encrypting document, just like paper-based signature.

**Beware**:
```
Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (encrypting)
Private key encrypts, public key decrypts (signing)
```

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [database](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[database]), &nbsp; [glossary](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[glossary])

In the field of databases in computer science, a transaction log (also transaction journal, database log, binary log or audit trail) is a history of actions executed by a database management system used to guarantee ACID properties over crashes or hardware failures. Physically, a log is a file listing changes to the database, stored in a stable storage format.
