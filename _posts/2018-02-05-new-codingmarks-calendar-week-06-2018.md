## caching 

**[CachesExplained · google/guava Wiki · GitHub](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [java](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[java]), &nbsp; [caching](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[caching])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/google/guava)

Wiki page with examples of using the caching of guava

## cheatsheet 

**[XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet - OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [cheatsheet](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cheatsheet])

This article provides a simple positive model for preventing [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) using output escaping/encoding properly. While there are a huge number of XSS attack vectors, following a few simple rules can completely defend against this serious attack. This article does not explore the technical or business impact of XSS. Suffice it to say that it can lead to an attacker gaining the ability to do anything a victim can do through their browser.

## coding 

**[One does not simply learn to code – freeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/one-does-not-simply-learn-to-code-f25bacdc5b62)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2016-06-16
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [coding](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[coding]), &nbsp; [marketing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[marketing])

One does not simply learn to code. Because coding isn’t easy. Coding is hard. Everyone knows that. Anyone who’s scoured a stack trace — or git detached their head — can tell you that. Unfortunately…

## cryptography 

**[scrypt - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [cryptgraphy](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cryptgraphy])

In cryptography, scrypt (pronounced "ess crypt"[1]) is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival, originally for the Tarsnap online backup service.[2] The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.

## cvs 

**[git-secret - A bash-tool to store your private data inside a git repository.](http://git-secret.io/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [git](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[git]), &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [cvs](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cvs])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret)

A bash-tool to store your private data inside a git repository.

## debugging 

**[Debugging - Getting Started Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [nodejs](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[nodejs]), &nbsp; [debugging](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[debugging])

This guide will help you get started debugging your Node.js apps and scripts.

## git 

**[git-crypt - transparent file encryption in git](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [git](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[git]), &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)

**git-crypt** enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when committed, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely share a repository containing a mix of public and private content. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files. This lets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the same repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire repository.

**[GitHub - google/guava: Google core libraries for Java](https://github.com/google/guava)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [java](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[java])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/google/guava)

Guava is a set of core libraries that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more!

In this talk, he shares his thoughts on how we can make the tools more approachable and delightful for the next generation of JavaScript developers.

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
