## network 

**[Spoofing attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [network](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[network]), &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])

In the context of network security, a spoofing attack is a situation in which one person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data, thereby gaining an illegitimate advantage.

<hr>


## networking 

**[Virtual LAN - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [networking](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[networking])

A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). VLANs work by applying tags to network packets and handling these tags in networking systems â€“ creating the appearance and functionality of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate networks. In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.

## security 

**[STRIDE (security) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security))**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])

STRIDE is a threat classification model developed by Microsoft for thinking about computer security threats.[1] It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories.

The threat categories are:

* Spoofing of user identity
* Tampering
* Repudiation
* Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
* Denial of service (D.o.S)
* Elevation of privilege


<hr>

**[Ransomware - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])

Ransomware is a type of malicious software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem â€“ and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult.

**[Spoofing attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [network](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[network]), &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])
