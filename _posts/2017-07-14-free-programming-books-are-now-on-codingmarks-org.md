I am really happy to announce that we've reached and surpassed our [goal of 1Mb of #codingmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj22xbE5ZiY&feature=youtu.be).
This was possible by importing the free programming books from the [Free-Programming-Books project](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books), which is one 
 of the most starred repository on GitHub. 
 
 You can look for all imported free books by typing `[free-programming-books]` (_**tag** filtering_) in the search bar, or by provide it as query parameter:
  [https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=Bfree-programming-books%5D](https://www.codingmarks.org/?q=%5Bfree-programming-books%5D).
  Either way you should get a result similar to the following:

  	<figcaption>Results when search for free-programming-books tag </figcaption>
  </figure>

<!--more--> 
 
 Of course you might want to filter more, and not scroll through 2700+ results, so you can either  add another search term `nodejs`, for example:
 
   <figure>
   	<img src="http://www.codingpedia.org/images/posts/free-programming-books/search-results-nodejs.png" alt="">
   	<figcaption>Results when search for free-programming-books tag plus nodejs term</figcaption>
   </figure>
 
 Or use **Filter by language** functionality and select **Spanish** for example:
 
   <figure>
   	<img src="http://www.codingpedia.org/images/posts/free-programming-books/search-results-spanish.png" alt="">
   	<figcaption>Results when search for free-programming-books tag in Spanish</figcaption>
   </figure>
 
 Or you can combine both - you get the idea... You can see this in action by watching the following videeo:

     If you wonder how I've done this, weill I have written a <a href="https://github.com/Codingpedia/codingmarks-free-programming-books-importer" target="_blank">simple Java importer</a>,
     to help me with the import.
