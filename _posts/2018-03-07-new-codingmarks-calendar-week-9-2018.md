**[Handling Observables with NgIf and the Async Pipe](https://toddmotto.com/angular-ngif-async-pipe)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2018-01-12
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [angular](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[angular])

There are a few common gotchas when dealing with purely cold Observables that somewhat pull in data (over perhaps, Http). There are also a few tricks we can use to mitigate common async issues, whilst being productive in templates.

So let’s explore how we can handle ngIf alongside the async pipe to alleviate some of these common issues.

## cryptography 

**[Weaknesses in Modern Cryptography](https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/634/weakness-modern-cryptography/101458)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2002-01-01
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [cryptography](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cryptography])

Modern cryptography has become the savior of the Internet, promising to secure our most
important information and communications by guarantying it may be not be deciphered
by any other than the intended recipient. This ideology has two flaws: Advances in
mathematics and computation may render current algorithms obsolete; Key management
and authentication in a large and complex environment are so difficult that they
undermine the mathematical strength of the best cryptographic algorithms.

**[Randomness and Entropy - An Introduction](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/vpns/randomness-entropy-introduction-874)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [cryptography](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cryptography])

This paper will attempt to bring together information pertaining to concepts and definitions of randomness and
entropy. Through definition and example both the implications and applications within the Information Security
industry will be shown, bringing a complex topic to light in a concise and understandable form.

## css 

**[CSS Grid Layout - CSS - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [css](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[css])

**CSS Grid Layout** excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

**[CSS Flexible Box Layout - CSS - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [css](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[css]), &nbsp; [flexbox](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[flexbox])

CSS Flexible Box Layout is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated.

## math 

**[Game theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [math](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[math])

Game theory is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers". Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science and biology. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

## microservices

## networking 

**[Bufferbloat - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [networking](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[networking])

Bufferbloat is a cause of high latency in packet-switched networks caused by excess buffering of packets. Bufferbloat can also cause packet delay variation (also known as jitter), as well as reduce the overall network throughput. When a router or switch is configured to use excessively large buffers, even very high-speed networks can become practically unusable for many interactive applications like voice over IP (VoIP), online gaming, and even ordinary web surfing.
