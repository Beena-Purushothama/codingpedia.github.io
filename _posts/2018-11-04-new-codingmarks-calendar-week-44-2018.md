New [codingmarks](https://www.codingmarks.org) published in the week 44 of 2018. Hot topics include:

## apache-zookeeper 

**[Apache ZooKeeper - Home](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [distributed-computing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[distributed-computing]), &nbsp; [apache-zookeeper](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[apache-zookeeper])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/apache/zookeeper)

Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.

## architecture 

**[GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2017-05-11
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [event-driven](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[event-driven]), &nbsp; [event-driven-design](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[event-driven-design]), &nbsp; [architecture](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[architecture]), &nbsp; [cqrs](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cqrs]), &nbsp; [event-sourcing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[event-sourcing])

During my career, I've often people heard people describe their systems as "event-driven". But when looking deeper that phrase seems to lead to some very different architectural assumptions. On a recent workshop we identified four different patterns which tend to appear under the title of "event-driven": event notification, event-based state transfer, event sourcing, and CQRS. We feel that understanding and using these more precise terms will lead to better communication and decision making.

## computer-science 

**[CAP theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [computer-science](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[computer-science]), &nbsp; [distributed-computing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[distributed-computing])

In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:
* **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response – with the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
* **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

In transaction processing, databases, and computer networking, the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is a type of atomic commitment protocol (ACP). It is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction (it is a specialized type of consensus protocol).

## transactions 

**[Two-phase commit protocol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [transactions](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[transactions]), &nbsp; [database](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[database]), &nbsp; [database-design](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[database-design])

In transaction processing, databases, and computer networking, the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) is a type of atomic commitment protocol (ACP). It is a distributed algorithm that coordinates all the processes that participate in a distributed atomic transaction on whether to commit or abort (roll back) the transaction (it is a specialized type of consensus protocol).

**[Transaction strategies: Understanding transaction pitfalls](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-ts1/index.html)**

Transaction processing should achieve a high degree of data integrity and consistency. This article, the first in a series on developing an effective transaction strategy for the Java platform, introduces common transaction pitfalls that can prevent you from reaching this goal. Using code examples from the Spring Framework and the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.0 specification, series author Mark Richards explains these all-too-common mistakes.
