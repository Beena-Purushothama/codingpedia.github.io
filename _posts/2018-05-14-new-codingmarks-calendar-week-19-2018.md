## architecture 

**[Application-level multi-tenancy: the promise and pitfalls of shared-everything architectures](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/news/2015/multitenancy.pdf)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [multi-tenant](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[multi-tenant]), &nbsp; [architecture](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[architecture]), &nbsp; [saas](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[saas]), &nbsp; [cloud](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cloud])

One of the key enablers to leverage economies of scale in SaaS applications is multi-tenancy [3, 5], i.e. the sharing of resources among multiple customer organisations, the so-called tenants. While in the previous paradigms a service provider manages one dedicated service setup per customer (cf. traditional application service provisioning (ASP)), multi-tenancy enables cloud providers to achieve higher resource utilization and scalability as well as to significantly reduce the operational costs.
