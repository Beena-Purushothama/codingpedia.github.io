## api 

**[5 Protocols For Event-Driven API Architectures](https://nordicapis.com/5-protocols-for-event-driven-api-architectures/)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2017-07-18
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [event-driven-design](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[event-driven-design]), &nbsp; [api](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[api]), &nbsp; [rest](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[rest]), &nbsp; [grpc](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[grpc]), &nbsp; [websocket](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[websocket])

We define and compare five ways to design event-driven APIs; WebSockets, Webhooks, REST Hooks, Server Sent Events (SSE), and Pub-Sub.

## api-design 

**[The GitHub GraphQL API](https://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [graphql](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[graphql]), &nbsp; [rest](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[rest]), &nbsp; [api-design](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[api-design])

GitHub announced a public API one month after the site launched. We’ve evolved this platform through three versions, adhering to RFC standards and embracing new design patterns to provide a clear and consistent interface. We’ve often heard that our REST API was an inspiration for other companies; countless tutorials refer to our endpoints. Today, we’re excited to announce our biggest change to the API since we snubbed XML in favor of JSON: we’re making the GitHub API available through GraphQL.

## distributed-tracing 

**[Dapper, a Large-Scale Distributed Systems Tracing Infrastructure](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub36356)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [distributed-tracing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[distributed-tracing])

##Abstract
Modern Internet services are often implemented as complex, large-scale distributed systems. These applications are constructed from collections of software modules that may be developed by different teams, perhaps in different programming languages, and could span many thousands of machines across multiple physical facili- ties. Tools that aid in understanding system behavior and reasoning about performance issues are invaluable in such an environment.

**[OpenZipkin · A distributed tracing system      ](https://zipkin.io/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [zipkin](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[zipkin]), &nbsp; [distributed-tracing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[distributed-tracing])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin)

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkin’s design is based on the [Google Dapper paper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).

This project includes a dependency-free library and a spring-boot server. Storage options include in-memory, JDBC (mysql), Cassandra, and Elasticsearch.

## git 

**[How to change the URI (URL) for a remote Git repository? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432764/how-to-change-the-uri-url-for-a-remote-git-repository)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [git](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[git])

You can
```
$ git remote set-url origin git://new.url.here
```
(see git help remote) or you can just edit `.git/config` and change the URLs there. You're not in any danger of losing history unless you do something very silly (and if you're worried, just make a copy of your repo, since your repo is your history.)

## graphql 

**[Lessons from 4 Years of GraphQL - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVNrqo9XGOs)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2016-11-03
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [graphql](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[graphql])

Lee Byron, GraphQL/Facebook. GraphQL has been in use at Facebook for over four years and evolved a lot before it was open sourced. During that time we learned a lot about what works and why, and derived a series of best practices. Hopefully our best practices and lessons learned are relevant not only to your use of GraphQL, but how you design and build all sorts of software.

Choosing an API design style can be downright daunting. The RPC vs. REST debate has raged for years, and now there's a new kid on the block: GraphQL. Which is right for your application? I'll demystify these API styles in clear terms and help you decide how to design your API.

Netscape 6.0 is finally going into its first public beta. There never was a version 5.0. The last major release, version 4.0, was released almost three years ago. Three years is an awfully long time in the Internet world. During this time, Netscape sat by, helplessly, as their market share plummeted.

It’s a bit smarmy of me to criticize them for waiting so long between releases. They didn’t do it on purpose, now, did they?

Today, we’re excited to announce our biggest change to the API since we snubbed XML in favor of JSON: we’re making the GitHub API available through GraphQL.
