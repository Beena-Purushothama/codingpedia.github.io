New [codingmarks](https://www.codingmarks.org) added in the 22th week of 2018. Hot topics include:

* TOC
{:toc} 

<!--more-->

## architecture 

**[Publish–subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [glossary](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[glossary]), &nbsp; [publish-subscribe](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[publish-subscribe]), &nbsp; [architecture](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[architecture])

In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

## publish-subscribe 

**[Confidentiality-Preserving Publish/Subscribe: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09404.pdf)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2016-01-01
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [publish-subscribe](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[publish-subscribe])

Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is an attractive communication paradigm for large-scale distributed applications running across multiple administrative domains. Pub/sub allows event-based information dissemination based on constraints on the nature of the data rather than on pre-established communication channels. It is a natural fit for deployment in untrusted environments such as public clouds linking applications across multiple sites. However, pub/sub in untrusted environments lead to major confidentiality concerns stemming from the content-centric nature of the communications. This survey classifies and analyzes different approaches to confidentiality preservation for pub/sub, from applications of trust and access control models to novel encryption techniques. It provides an overview of the current challenges posed by confidentiality concerns and points to future research directions in this promising field.

**[Publish-Subscribe Threat Modeling – Security Compass](https://blog.securitycompass.com/publish-subscribe-threat-modeling-11add54f1d07)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2016-11-21
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [publish-subscribe](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[publish-subscribe]), &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security])

The decoupled multicast nature of many-to-many communications in the Publish-Subscribe pattern introduces the system components to threats such as unwanted traffic flooding, node compromise attacks, data tampering, privacy violation, and so on. We have identified the potential risks based on Microsoft’s [STRIDE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/commerce-server/ee823878(v=cs.20)) model. Figure 2 relates STRIDE threats to possible attacks and potential solutions in a Publish-Subscribe ecosystem.
