## angular 

**[Insider’s guide into interceptors and HttpClient mechanics in Angular](https://blog.angularindepth.com/insiders-guide-into-interceptors-and-httpclient-mechanics-in-angular-103fbdb397bf)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2018-01-09
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [angular](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[angular]), &nbsp; [http](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[http])

The documentation for the interceptors is pretty good and shows how to write and register an interceptor. Here I’ll dig deeper into internal mechanics of the HtppClient service and interceptors in particular. I believe this knowledge is necessary to make advanced usage of the feature. After reading the article you’ll be able to easily understand workflows like caching and we’ll be able to effectively implement complex request/response manipulation scenarios.

**[RxJS: Understanding Lettable Operators – Angular In Depth](https://blog.angularindepth.com/rxjs-understanding-lettable-operators-fe74dda186d3)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2017-09-26
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [angular](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[angular])

Lettable operators offer a new way of composing observable chains and they have advantages for both application developers and library authors.

Lettable operators are a higher-order functions. Lettable operators return functions that receive and return observables; and those functions can be passed to the `let` operator.

**[Angular's NgIf, Else, Then - Explained](https://toddmotto.com/angular-ngif-else-then)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2018-01-11
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [angular](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[angular])

Using the `ngIf` directive allows us to simply toggle content based on a conditional. But is it as simple as we think? Not quite, the directive has a heap of helpful syntaxes that can help us deal with conditionals far better, and also asynchronous objects coming from perhaps an Observable.

Let’s explore the ins and outs of `ngIf`, and how we can utilise (the right way) in our Angular apps.

## arquillian 

**[Test run modes - Arquillian - Project Documentation Editor](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Test+run+modes)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [arquillian](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[arquillian]), &nbsp; [testing](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[testing])

Arquillian comes with two run modes, **in container** and as **client**. in container is to test your application internals and as client is to test how your application is used by clients. Lets dive a bit deeper into the differences between the run modes and see how they effect your test execution and packaging.

Decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.

While ES5 object literals support arbitrary expressions in the value position, ES6 classes only support literal functions as values. Decorators restore the ability to run code at design time, while maintaining a declarative syntax.

## maven 

**[Calen Legaspi: Separating Integration Tests from Unit Tests Using Maven Failsafe & JUnit @Category](http://calenlegaspi.blogspot.ch/2015/01/separating-integration-tests-from-unit.html)**

TDD at the Unit Testing level is fairly straight-forward, since classes in unit testing either do not have complex dependencies, or you mock-out the dependencies with a mocking framework (ex. Mockito). However, TDD quickly becomes difficult when we get to Integration Testing. Integration Testing is basically testing a component with some or all of its dependencies instead of mocking them all out. Examples are tests the cut across multiple layers, tests that read or write to a database or file system, tests that require a Servlet container or EJB container to be up, tests that involve network communication, web services, etc.
