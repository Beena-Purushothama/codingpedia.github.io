## big-data 

**[The Essential Guide to Machine Data](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/ebooks/the-essential-guide-to-machine-data.pdf)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [security](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[security]), &nbsp; [splunk](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[splunk]), &nbsp; [big-data](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[big-data]), &nbsp; [cloud](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[cloud])

Whatever you call it, machine data is one of the most underused and undervalued assets of any organization. And, unfortunately, it’s usually kept for some minimum amount of time before being tossed out and never looked at again.

**[An Introduction To Securing a Cloud Environment](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/cloud/introduction-securing-cloud-environment-34052)**

While Cloud services offer flexibility, scalability and economies of scale, there have been commensurate concerns about security. As more data moves from centrally located server storage to the Cloud, the potential for personal and private data to be compromised will increase. Confidentiality, availability and integrity of data are at risk if appropriate measures are not put in place prior to selecting a Cloud vendor or implementing your own cloud and migrating to Cloud services.

Article describing how to use composition and inheritance in Java program designs.

### Inheritance
When you establish an inheritance relationship between two classes, you get to take advantage of dynamic binding and polymorphism. Dynamic binding means the JVM will decide at runtime which method implementation to invoke based on the class of the object. Polymorphism means you can use a variable of a superclass type to hold a reference to an object whose class is the superclass or any of its subclasses.

### The composition alternative
Given that the inheritance relationship makes it hard to change the interface of a superclass, it is worth looking at an alternative approach provided by composition. It turns out that when your goal is code reuse, composition provides an approach that yields easier-to-change code.

## typescript 

**[Declaration Merging     ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [typescript](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[typescript])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)

Some of the unique concepts in TypeScript describe the shape of JavaScript objects at the type level. One example that is especially unique to TypeScript is the concept of ‘declaration merging’. Understanding this concept will give you an advantage when working with existing JavaScript. It also opens the door to more advanced abstraction concepts.
