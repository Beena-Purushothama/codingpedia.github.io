## .net 

**[Why do interface names begin with “I” – Brad Abrams ](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brada/2004/02/03/why-do-interface-names-begin-with-i/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [c#](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[c#]), &nbsp; [.net](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[.net]), &nbsp; [coding-dispute](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[coding-dispute])

I am in the having one of those very useless “what-should-we-have-done” debates with a guy on my team and I thought I suck you folks into it.   It is around naming of interfaces with an “I” prefix.  Something COM founded (I think, does anyone know of an earlier example?) but java snubbed.

## agile 

**[Agile Thinking : Stop Starting, Start Finishing](http://www.agilebuddha.com/agile/agile-thinking-stop-starting-start-finishing/)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [agile](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[agile])

On its outset it looks like, "Stop starting, start finishing" philosophy is limited to Lean. Scrum world is either doing it well or doesn't need it. Right?

## glossary 

**[Hungarian notation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [glossary](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[glossary])

Hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its intention or kind, and in some dialects its type. The original Hungarian Notation uses intention or kind in its naming convention and is sometimes called Apps Hungarian as it became popular in the Microsoft Apps division in the development of Word, Excel and other apps. As the Microsoft Windows division adopted the naming convention, they used the actual data type for naming, and this convention became widely spread through the Windows API; this is sometimes called Systems Hungarian notation.

## javaee 

**[java ee - Unsatisfied dependencies for type X with qualifiers @Default - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27706091/unsatisfied-dependencies-for-type-x-with-qualifiers-default?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa)**

  * **tags**: &nbsp; [javaee](https://www.codingmarks.org/search?q=[javaee])

In Java EE 7, the default scanning for JARs/WARs is annotated, meaning that if you don't have a `beans.xml` that specifies the scan mode, it will default to annotated based scanning.

## javascript 

**[Async programming basics every JS developer should know in 2018](https://dev.to/siwalik/async-programming-basics-every-js-developer-should-know-in-2018-a9c)**
