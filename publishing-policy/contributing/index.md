  Here, at <a style="color: #bc360a;" title="Codingpedia.org - about us" href="http://www.codingpedia.org/about/" target="_blank">Codingpedia.org</a>, we are firm believers that technological advancement and efficiency, driven among other things by the humans’ ability to program machines, has a positive impact on human evolution and well-being. We want to contribute to the expansion of this ability by offering a platform for sharing coding knowledge. We know you are talented, so we invite you to join our efforts and become a guest/regular writer for <a title="Codingpedia.org, sharing coding knowledge" href="http://www.codingpedia.org" target="_blank">Codingpedia.org </a>(we&#8217;ll call you a Coding Contributor).

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">
  <em><strong>Note:</strong> No time to contribute original posts to Codingpedia.org yet, but you still have coding-related articles worth sharing, then you can join our <a title="Coding Friend Program" href="http://www.codingpedia.org/friends" target="_blank">Coding Friend Program</a> and have your best ones republished. </em>

  * get more quality connections on Twitter, GitHub or Google Plus, via the author link
  * all your posts will include the <strong>nickname/author name</strong> you choose to represent you on the website (e.g. <a href="http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/how-to-handle-session-timeout-exceptions-in-spring-mvc/">http://www.codingpedia.org/<strong>ama</strong>/how-to-handle-session-timeout-exceptions-in-spring-mvc/</a>)
  * your posts will be promoted on our social media channels and will be part of the <a title="Codingpedia.org - RSS feed" href="http://www.codingpedia.org/feed.xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>
  * you can bring your own sponsors and adds for the articles you contribute
  * build a reputation and give something back to the community

  * become a member of our organization on GitHub &#8211; <a title="https://github.com/Codingpedia" href="https://github.com/Codingpedia" target="_blank">CodingpediaOrg</a>
  * you&#8217;ll definitely improve your writing skills with every new article

### <span id="Role">Role</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You will start as a <strong>Contributor</strong>, which means your posts will be reviewed before being published. If you post regularly and gain trust you can become an <strong>Author</strong> and then you can publish and manage your own posts. But why settle for Author and not go for <strong>Editor</strong>? As an editor you can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
</p>

### <span id="Writing_hints">Writing hints</span>

Just a few hints to consider when writing for Codingpedia.org

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  the content has to be original, meaning it will have to be initially posted on <a title="Codingpedia.org, sharing coding knowledge" href="http://www.codingpedia.org" target="_blank">Codingpedia.org</a> and every republishing of the article elsewhere will have to reference it
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  content is the most important thing in your post. So make it original, useful, relevant, simple, easy-to-read and <a title="Make content scannable" href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/08/19/writing-blog-content-make-it-scannable/http://" target="_blank">scannable</a>.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  preferably provide some source code (GitHub etc.) or a live example of the code/technology you present
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  give credit to others and put reference links at the end of the article
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  be polite and open when replying to comments
</li>
