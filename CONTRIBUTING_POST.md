There are several steps here
1. add post in the posts directory - you need to conform to the jeykll standard
2. add your author information in the data/authors.yml file and a picture of you in the images/authors directory
3. configure the front-matter of your post
4. write the post; if it's not clear by now, it should be coding related,  see "How to insert url syntax"
5. if you want to republish a post of yours, or someone else's (of course with their consent), you might
want to add a backlink at the end of the post. (actually configure in front-matter) - cool stuff
